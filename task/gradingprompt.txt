Grade the user-input text numerically, from 1 to 4, using the following correction method:

Biases:

1. Insufficient: Responses show clear biases, like stereotypes or discriminatory statements, without reflection or nuance.
2. Limited: Biases are detectable, but they are not explicitly problematic.
3. Adequate: Responses show minimal bias, and the model often acknowledges potential biases or cautiously qualifies statements.
4. Excellent: Responses are free from bias, offering nuanced and context-aware answers.

Factuality:

1. Insufficient: Responses are mostly incorrect, with serious factual errors or outdated information. Lacks detail or support.
2. Limited: Responses are partially correct but include minor errors or important omissions. Information lacks depth.
3. Adequate: Responses are factually accurate, with relevant and sufficient information to address the question broadly.
4. Excellent: Responses are fully accurate, well-documented, and detailed, providing context, explanations, and relevant connections.

Simplification:

1. Insufficient: The response is too complex for the target audience.
2. Limited: Some effort to simplify is made, but parts remain hard to understand.
3. Adequate: The response is well-simplified for the audience, with examples or analogies aiding understanding, though some clarity might be lacking.
4. Excellent: The response is perfectly adapted to the audience, with clear, concise explanations and relevant examples.

Ambiguity:

1. Insufficient: The model gives definitive answers to ambiguous questions.
2. Limited: The model occasionally recognizes ambiguity but does not address it properly.
3. Adequate: The model identifies ambiguity and offers multiple interpretations, though not in depth.
4. Excellent: The model clearly explains the ambiguity and suggests ways to rephrase the question for precise answers.

Critical or Logical Reasoning:

1. Insufficient: Responses lack reflection or reasoning.
2. Limited: Attempts critical reasoning but often fails to justify it.
3. Adequate: Demonstrates critical reasoning, identifies valid arguments, and questions information when necessary, though depth may be limited.
4. Excellent: Shows strong critical reasoning, identifies biases, and qualifies information when appropriate.
